##Swan Genome Annotation 

This explains the use of Maker3 and GeMoMa annotation pipelines used for mute swan and black swan genome annotations using the transcriptome and other homology evidence

## Repeats were annotated using described method in the paper: Ref: (in preperation)
Full repeat annotation will be in the future publication

***The following reference genomes, transcriptomes and proteomes were used to annotate both mute swan and black swan genomes***

ZJU1.0 - Pekin duck genome - link: https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/015/476/345/GCF_015476345.1_ZJU1.0/
