# Maker3 : Mute_swan Genome Annotation (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_009769625.2)
This explains the Maker3 annotation for mute swan genome using the transcriptome we built and other homology evidence
## Trancriptome was built using mute swan periheral blood obtained from Sweden

## Repeats were annotated using described method in the paper: Ref: (in preperation)
Full repeat annotation will be in the future publication

***The following reference genomes, transcriptomes and proteomes were used to annotate both mute swan and black swan genomes***
